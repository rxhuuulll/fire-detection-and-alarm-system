## Installation
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/username/fire-and-smoke-detection.git
2. Install the dependencies: pip install opencv-python numpy playsound

## Usage
1. Run the fire_and_smoke_detection.py file: python fire_and_smoke_detection.py

3. When fire or smoke is detected, an alarm sound will play.
4. Press 'q' to exit the script and stop the alarm.
